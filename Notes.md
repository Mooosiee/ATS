### SSR = **Server-Side Rendering**
Normally in React, your app runs **in the browser** (on the client). That means things like `window`, `document`, and `localStorage` are always there.
But in some frameworks like **Next.js**, React components can also render **on the server first** (before being sent to the browser).
That’s called **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.
---
### How it works
1. You request a page → Next.js runs React **on the server**.
2. It generates an HTML version of your page.
3. That HTML is sent to the browser quickly → good for SEO & performance.
4. Then React “hydrates” it in the browser and becomes fully interactive.
---
### ⚠️ The problem
On the **server**, there is:
* ❌ No `window`
* ❌ No `document`
* ❌ No `localStorage`
So if your code tries to do:
console.log(window.innerWidth);
…it will **crash on the server** (because `window` doesn’t exist there).
---
### Why we wrote
typeof window !== "undefined"
This check makes sure your code only runs in the **browser**, not on the server.
That way your app works fine whether it’s rendered on the client or during SSR.
---
In short:
* **CSR (Client-Side Rendering):** Everything runs in the browser.
* **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** First render happens on the server, then the browser takes over.

### 1. **WHAT IS PUTER**
* **Web OS**: It’s not a typical program or library—it’s a complete operating system that you can use in a browser window.
* **Full desktop experience**: It provides windows, apps, file management, terminals, and other OS-like functionality.
* **Cross-platform**: Since it runs in the browser, it works on Windows, macOS, Linux, or even tablets and phones.

---

### 2. **Key Features**

* **Desktop environment**: You get a start menu, icons, and multiple windows like a real OS.
* **Terminal/CLI**: You can run commands in a built-in terminal.
* **Apps**: Includes apps like a code editor, notes, media players, and more.
* **Cloud integration**: Save files and projects directly in the cloud.
* **AI-powered tools**: It integrates AI for coding, writing, image generation, etc.

---

### 3. **Why It Exists**

* **Experimentation**: Lets developers explore a full OS without installing anything.
* **Web-first development**: Run applications, code, and AI models entirely in the browser.
* **Learning & prototyping**: Great for learning OS concepts, trying out web apps, or quickly prototyping projects.

---

### 4. **Relation to Puter.js**

* **Puter.js is the developer-facing part**: If Puter is the OS you interact with, Puter.js is the **toolkit for building apps that run inside Puter**, or even outside it using the same serverless, cloud-integrated features.

---

Think of it like **Windows or macOS—but running in your browser**, with extra features for web developers.

If you want, I can **explain exactly how it works under the hood**—like how a full OS can run in a browser and still feel “real.” That’s pretty cool! Do you want me to do that?


**TypeScript interface — basically a blueprint that describes what a “user object” looks like.**
**its not actual data, it’s a type used by TypeScript so your editor (and compiler) knows what to expect.**
